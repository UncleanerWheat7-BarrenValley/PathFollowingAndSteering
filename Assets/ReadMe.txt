In this project there are 3 scenes. 
2 of the scenes show an element of some basic AI (Follow, Avoidance).
The 3rd scene (Race) brings these elements together to create an AI race with 8 racers.

While playing the race scene you can see a top down view of the racers traversing the track.
Clicking a racer will allow you to view that particular driver.
Clicking again will return you to the top down view.
